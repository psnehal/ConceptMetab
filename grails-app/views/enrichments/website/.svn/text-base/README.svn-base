---------
Structure
=========

The file structure mimics that of the navigation of the site.


.htaccess
=========

This file creates the nice URLs of pages.

http://host/foo/bar     =>      http://host/index.php?navigation_link=foo&page_link=bar
http://host/get/foo     =>      http://host/php/content/foo
http://host/file/foo    =>      http://host/file/foo

Because the first rule is automatic, the get and foo directories are overridden to provide access
to specific PHP files in HTML (e.g. in an iframe) and files to download.

Just remember to set the "AllowOverride" directive to "All" (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/core.html#allowoverride).


file/
=====

Put files here if you want to make them available for download or external access.


==

index.php
=========

The index.php file ensures that all references to files within the site's PHP code is relative to
the root directory of the site.


php/

    layout/
    =======
    
    The layout mechanism allows for the site to use a like template for all pages.  Each page has
    a page ID ($page_link) and a top level navigation link ($navigation_link).  The URL of a page
    is then
    
    http://host/$navigation_link/$page_link
    
    
        page.php
        ========
        
        This file is the template of the site.  Its structure is as follows.
        
        * Declaration
        * Header
        * Page content (include)
        * Footer
        
        
        declaration.php
        ===============
        
        This file contains the functionality for automatic inclusion of secondary files (CSS, JS, 
        et cetera) based on file name for the pages of the site.
        
        It also contains the top level navigation list.  You need to modify the list to change the
        links listed across the top of the site.  DO NOT MODIFY header.php TO CHANGE THE LINKS.  THE
        LINKS IN header.php ARE AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED TO MATCH WHAT IS LISTED IN declaration.php.
        
        
        header.php
        ==========
        
        This file contains the top of the page, including navigation.
        
        
        footer.php
        ==========
        
        This file contains the footer of the page, including link outs.
        
        
        functions.php
        =============
        
        This file contains functions common to the pages so that they can be used throughout the
        site.  The page.php file includes functions.php so that the functions are available in all
        subsequent PHP code.


    content
    =======
    
    For a page, its PHP content is grabbed from the content directory.
    
    URL                                                     Page content
    ---------------------------------------                 ---------------------------------------
    http://host/$navigation_link/$page_link                 content/$navigation_link/$page_link.php
    http://host/$navigation_link                            content/$navigation_link.php
    
    Similarly, .declaration.php files are included automatically for pages under the
    $navigation_link and $page_link.  Thus,
    
    content/about.declaration.php           applies to        http://host/about
                                                and to        http://host/about/*
        
    And,
    
    content/about/license.declaration.php   applies to        http://host/about/license
    
    A $navigation_link page can be made to have pages underneath it by defining the $page_links
    array in $navigation_link.declaration.php.
    
    $page_links = array(
        "page_id1" => "Page name 1",
        "page_id2" => "Page name 2"
    );
    
    The first page in the list will be the page that is displayed after clicking the top level
    navigation link.
    
    The value of the $content_style variable determines what the layout of the page will be.
