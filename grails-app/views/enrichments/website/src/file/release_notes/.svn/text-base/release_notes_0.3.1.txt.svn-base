<p>
    This minor release fixes an issue that could crash IE and Firefox on Windows.
    It also has a few other changes, including a default <code>Passthrough Mapper</code> for edge labels,
    and a better <code>png()</code> function that does not crop the image anymore.

        <li><span class="bug_id">2130</span>: Circle layout doesn't "zoom to fit".</li>

    <ul class="other_changes">
        <li>Added a default Passthrough Mapper for edge labels, making it easier to display them 
            (you just need to have an edge attribute called <code>"label"</code> in the network data and 
            set <code>edgeLabelsVisible</code> to <code>true</code>).</li>
        <li>Removed the mouse-over tool tip from the Pan-Zoom Control and kept only the one that appears
            when dragging the zoom slider.</li>
    </ul>
